# WhatsApp-Chat-Sentimental-Analysis
With the exponential growth of social media users, 
people are really curious about the type of conversation they 
have with other people and also how communication leads in 
group chats, with this Web App tool we focus on providing the 
user with insightful analysis of their chats with other people, 
some of the statistics include, total messages, total words, most 
used words, emoji analysis, and some more, off all the social 
media chatting apps we have chosen WhatsApp as it is used 
purely for conversations purposes so that it can provide us with 
the most helpful dataset, after performing these analysis, we 
have also performed machine learning analysis using 
supervised machine learning algorithm Random Forest 
Classifier in order to perform sentimental analysis, we have 
used Random forest classifier as it is a boosting algorithm and 
provides extremely good results for binary classification. We will 
export our WhatsApp chats and we can directly upload it to our 
Web App to get the sentimental analysis.

 # Conclusion 
 In conclusion, the application of sentiment analysis 
using Random Forest classification has proven to be highly 
effective, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 92%. 
This indicates the robustness and reliability of the model in 
accurately classifying sentiments within the analyzed data. 
The Random Forest algorithm's ability to handle complex 
relationships and capture subtle patterns in the data has 
contributed to its success in discerning sentiments with a 
high degree of accuracy.
The achieved accuracy not only demonstrates the 
proficiency of the model in understanding and classifying 
sentiments but also underscores its potential for real-world 
applications. Businesses, social media platforms, and 
various other domains can leverage this sentiment analysis 
model to gain valuable insights into public opinion and 
customer feedback. The high accuracy suggests that the 
model is well-suited for tasks such as brand monitoring, 
market research, and customer satisfaction analysis.
However, it is essential to acknowledge that while 
accuracy is a crucial metric, it is not the sole determinant of 
a model's performance. Consideration should also be given 
to other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to 
obtain a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's 
effectiveness.
In conclusion, the success of sentiment analysis using 
Random Forest classification with a 92% accuracy rate 
opens up avenues for practical applications, showcasing the 
potential for informed decision-making and enhanced 
understanding of sentiments in diverse datasets. 
As advancements in machine learning continue, the 
integration of such models into various industries is likely 
to grow, offering valuable insights and contributing to 
improved decision-making processes.
